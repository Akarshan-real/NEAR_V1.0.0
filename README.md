# 🏙️ NEAR – Neighbourhood Empowerment & Assistance Network

> **"This is not an app. This is a city-scale operating system for communities."**

### 🧐 What is NEAR?
NEAR is a hyper-local, block-level network where every residential cluster (apartment complex, street, or village) transforms into a **self-governed digital micro-community**.

**We are the Anti-Social Media:**
* 🚫 **No Global Feeds:** You don't need to know what someone in another country ate for lunch.
* 🚫 **No Influencers:** Clout means nothing here. Helping neighbors means everything.
* 🚫 **No Dopamine Loops:** We optimize for utility, not addiction.

### 🧱 The Core Unit: "The Block"
Everything happens within a **Block** — a strict 300–600 meter radius containing 30–300 households.
* **Real Humans Only:** Entry is verified via address proof and community approval.
* **Local Focus:** Only people who can physically reach you in minutes.

### 🏗️ How It Works (The 4 Layers)

**1. 🧍 Member Layer (Who)**
Residents aren't just names; they are **assets**. Everyone is tagged by **Skills** (Doctor, Plumber, Tutor) and **Resources** (Drill, Generator, Ladder) to help the community.

**2. 🛡️ Trust Layer (Safety)**
We don't use "Followers"; we use **Community Proof**.
* **Stranger Shield:** Outsiders cannot DM you.
* **Risk Heatmap:** AI detects suspicious patterns instantly.

**3. 🤖 AI Core (The Brain)**
The "Smart Routing" engine. When you need help, the AI doesn't spam the whole block. It calculates **Urgency + Proximity + Trust** and notifies only the top 5 people best suited to help.

**4. 🧩 Governance Layer (Order)**
No chaos. Every block elects its own **Block Captains** and **Safety Marshals** every 6 months to handle disputes and emergencies.

### 🚀 Why NEAR?
We are building a digital nervous system for cities. From **One-Tap SOS** alerts to **Sharing Oxygen Cylinders**, NEAR is designed to make neighborhoods resilient, safe, and self-sufficient.

**NEAR connects you to the people who matter most when the internet goes down.**
